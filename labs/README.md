# Getting started with OpenTelemetry Labs

## How to use this repo
In here you will find all labs that we created sorted in differen directories. These directories correspond with the chapters of the tutorial. So if you read the tutorial and want to start with an excercise just open the right directory.

In most directories you will find a initial and a solution directory. These contain an initial state of the application and a final state of the application. You may want to start with the initial state and if you get stuck you can look up the solution in the solution directory. Just keep in mind that you don't get a learning effect if you just look up the solution.
